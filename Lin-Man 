10/23/19	2	My son built this masterpiece while I was out of town																								
10/23/19	3	The last song we added to the show reflects this perfectly: We're Not Done, written with all of us in the room, Jeff and Lacamoire included, pitching ideas until it was what you see on stage. Which echoes how we felt: WE'RE NOT DONE WRITING THIS THING.																								
10/23/19	4	The process began with a bang because Blanck and Jeff Whitty saw it so clearly: the momentum, the characters, the tone. The process mirrored the theme of the show: we thought we'd be writing in separate corners, but what we can make together is greater than what we make alone.																								
10/23/19	5	Struggles we faced: balancing songwriting with the HEAVY cheering & dancing: you can't hold a note if you're flipping. Finding stacatto work-arounds, being SO mindful of the triple threats on stage, when they breathe. The Alliance was dope & so was Tap, the restaurant next door																								
10/23/19	6	It was different because I got to co-write a score, and I learned so many new approaches to writing. Some songs are me Tom & Amanda, some are me & Tom, some are me and Amanda riffing, some are me alone, working from Andy's choreographic vision. Just reinforced best idea winning.																								
10/23/19	7	Just a shout out to @Linmirandacom, who I've never had the pleasure of meeting, but keeps track of my life far better than I do

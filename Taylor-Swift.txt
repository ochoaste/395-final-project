10/28/19	1	I was promised Lively  But Shelton is cool too. SO excited to be on @NBCTheVoice with @blakeshelton tonight at 8/7c!
10/25/19	1	Talked with @zanelowe about @catsmovie + my original song for the film ""Beautiful Ghosts"  Watch the clip now - but we talked about a lot more than that so listen to our full conversation coming next Wednesday on @AppleMusic @Beats1! https://Apple.co/taylorb1
10/24/19	1	I was so excited when @OfficialALW asked me to write an original song with him for @catsmovie. “Beautiful Ghosts” is performed in the film by the extraordinary Francesca Hayward who plays “Victoria” & reprised by Dame Judi Dench (!!!!!) who plays “Old Deuteronomy”  Coming soon!
10/24/19	2	Because of you, there was a 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th and 7th album. You guys made me into a headliner because you wanted to see me play. And your support all these years is what’s helped me stay true to that kid I was when I started out. #13YearsOfTaylor
10/24/19	3	I said in an interview 13 years ago "I'm just hoping that I have a second album that does as well as the first & someday get to be a headliner, & always be the same person that I started out as.” Scrolling through your posts has me feeling all the feelings & I want to thank you.
10/23/19	1	Be sure to watch next week!
